I'm a Network Technician & a Computer Engineering student who's interested in Cloud, Hardware, AI and Robotics.
* ðŸ”­ My big project at the moment is my [Systems & Programming Fundamentals Roadmap](https://lab-book.01blu3.com/books/systems-programming-fundamentals).
* ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning about Linux and about to get further into bash.
* ðŸ§  I'm also messing around with running local LLM's it's been more engrossing than I expected.
* âŒ› In the near future I plan on learning C and beging working on the Linux programming interface.
* âš¡ Recently, I've picked up cardio and weight lifting again, I've also started taking my Japanese language studies more seriously.
